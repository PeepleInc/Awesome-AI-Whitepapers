  - #### [Buzz: An Extensible Programming Language for Self-Organizing Heterogeneous Robot Swarms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05946.pdf)
      > Buzz is an Extensible Programming Language for Heterogeneous Robot Swarms. The language advocates a compositional approach, offering primitives to define behaviors both from the perspective of the single robot and the overall swarm. We show the capabilities of Buzz by providing examples, and analyze scalability and robustness of the language's run-time platform.
