  - [Buzz: An Extensible Programming Language for Self-Organizing Heterogeneous Robot Swarms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05946.pdf)
      > An Extensible Programming Language for Heterogeneous Robot Swarms. We present Buzz, a novel programming language for heterogeneous robot swarms. The language advocates a compositional approach, offering primitives to define behaviors both from the perspective of the single robot and of the overall swarm. Single-robot primitives include robot-specific instructions, and for the dynamic management of robot teams. Swarm-based primitives also enable the dynamic sharing of information globally across the swarm. We show the capabilities of Buzz by providing examples, and analyze scalability and robustness of the language's run-time platform through realistic simulated experiments with swarm algorithms.
